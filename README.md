# Generative-animations

Generative animations is a sound-reactive piece in which an envelope follower is used to make the animations move. Made through experimentation with Perlin noise, PI and arithmetic operations. The result is to create an experience for viewers with drawings controlled in a noticeable way both visually and through audio input.
